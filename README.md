Installed Debian 10.1 on my home system

Started the process of creating a user add script.

Challenges: My bash skills are a bit rusty, and my python skills are even rustier. 
I had to refresh a lot before getting started

W/E 9/28

Challenges:

W/E 10/5

Finished the grep lab and continued working on the User Add script.

Challenges: Still having to google lots of small things I've forgotten about bash command line and scripting.

W/E 10/12

Will be working on SED/AWK lab along with hopefully finishing my user add script. 
Im starting to feel very comfortable in bash again.

Challenges: None so far, but Im sure thatll change once I start the sed/awk lab 
as I have had little to no exposure to these tools in previous classes

W/E 10/19

Working through Sed/Awk and finishing Useradd script still.

Challenges: Regular expressions have become something of a rock climbing wall to me. 
Thankfully I found a web tool that lets you create, test, and view regular expressoins in real time

W/E 10/26 - W/E 11/23

Presented Github portfolio.
Worked on Lab assignments. Finished Sed/Awk, Continue Setup
Organized Github for easier navigation and readability. 

W/E 11/30

Ate turkey, mashed potatoes, green beans, and other thanksgiving foods.
Finished the first draft of the UserAdd script. Successfully reads from a file and creates the new users. Creating a duplicate
username is possible, however very unlikely. 
Works with names with as few as two parts and as many as infinity. If one name is passed (Such as McLovin), then the user will
be assigned the first letter of their name followed by that same name. (mmclovin)
Finished networking lab

W/E 12/7

Continued working on labs and preparing Github portfolio for final presentation.

W/E 12/14
