W/E 10/5

Finished the grep lab and continued working on the User Add script.

Challenges: Still having to google lots of small things I've forgotten about bash command line and scripting.

W/E 10/12

Will be working on SED/AWK lab along with hopefully finishing my user add script. Im starting to feel very comfortable in bash again.

Challenges: None so far, but Im sure thatll change once I start the sed/awk lab as I have had little to no exposure to these tools in previous classes
